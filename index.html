        <p>Did you know Cygnus – the latin word for “swan” – is a brightly visible constellation also known as the northern cross.</p>
        <p> In Greek mythology, the constellation represents Orpheus, who was transformed into a swan after death – next to his lyre, in the constellation Lyra.</p>
        <p>Did you also know that in the wild, swans can live to be over 20 years old!</p>

        <p>Funfact - chameleons have eyes in the backs of their heads!</p>
        <p>Well, not literally – but they can move their eyes separately, with each eye having a field of 180 degrees.</p>
        <p>They also have extremely powerful tongues.</p>
